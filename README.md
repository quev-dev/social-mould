### Live Version of Project
[Social Mould](https://social-mould.netlify.app/)

### Introduction
This **web app** will **generate a professional social media profile** based off of user input. The user provides a username and topic of interest, and searches for images with a search bar powered by the **Unsplash API.**
* Upon generating a profile, a preview and download section will be provided.
* The download links allow the user to download the full-res version of the images they've selected.
* The download section includes the bio and a button to copy the bio to the clipboard.

### How it Works:

In the form, you'll want to provide the following information:
* Desired username
* Image for profile picture
* Image for banner
* Something you're interested in

Then, just click 'Mould' and you'll be able to see a preview of your profile! You'll also be able to download the full-resolution versions of the images you've selected, and you can click a button to copy the generated profile bio.
* If you'd like to change the generated profile, just update the form inputs and you'll see live changes.
